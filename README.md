# Kaloix Sensor System
> **Notice:** This project was made with only personal use by me in mind. Code is not commentated, maybe bad structured and the user interface is in German language.

## Client
### Features
* Import relevant sensors from `sensor.json`
* Collect and parse sensor data using a file system interface
* Export data as CSV files to folder `csv/`
* Copy these files to the server, when new data is available

### Installation
The base platform is  **Debian Jessie** with **Python 3.4**. Install german locale by uncommenting `de_DE.UTF-8 UTF-8` in `/etc/locale.gen` and run `sudo locale-gen`.

1-Wire temperature sensor:

    modprobe w1-gpio
    modprobe w1-therm

Seven Segment Optical Character Recognition:

    sudo apt-get install libimlib2 libimlib2-dev pyton3-numpy python3-scipy python3-pil

Usage:

    ./client.py <station>

The *station* parameter corresponds with the same field in the sensor list of `sensor.json`.

## Server
### Features
* Import sensor list from `sensor.json`
* Monitor directory `csv/` for new sensor data
* Send admin email on missing sensor updates and crash
* Send user email on out of range sensor values
* Generate `index.html` document with sensor values from `template.md` and `template.html`
* Generate `plot.png` with sensor history
* Copy these files in webserver directory

### Usage
    cp static/* <web_dir>
    pip install virtualenv
    virtualenv --python=python3 ve/
    source ve/bin/activate
    pip install markdown matplotlib pytz
    ./server.py
    deactivate
